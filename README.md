## Setup
1. Replace ${FONTAWESOME_TOKEN} in `.npmrc` with the token you can find in 1Password
2. Run the following commands:

```sh
git submodule init
git submodule update
yarn install
bundle install
```

## Usage

```sh
bundle exec middleman
```

Open the browser at [localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567/) and click around.

## Building

We currently have a known issue where we can't build the project with the
`--parallel` flag (Which is set to `true` by default).

To make building easier you can run a wrapper around the build script:

```sh
bin/build
```

## Deployment

```sh
bundle exec rake build_deploy
```

## Content

### Markdown customizations

To render notices we've added a custom markdown tag. Use it like so:

```markdown
!> This is a warning!
-> This is a notice!

# I'm a heading
#^prefix I'm a heading
#=anchor-override I'm a heading
```

Which will render the following:

```html
<div class="custom-wrapper warning">
  <p>This is a warning!</p>
</div>
<div class="custom-wrapper notice">
  <p>This is a notice!</p>
</div>

<h1><span class="anchor" id="im-a-heading"></span><a href="#im-a-heading">I'm a heading</a></h1>
<h1><span class="anchor" id="prefix-im-a-heading"></span><a href="#prefix-im-a-heading">I'm a heading</a></h1>
<h1><span class="anchor" id="anchor-override"></span><a href="#anchor-override">I'm a heading</a></h1>
```

For more information (and code) about these customizations, please see the
[`appsignal_markdown.rb`](lib/appsignal_markdown.rb) file.
